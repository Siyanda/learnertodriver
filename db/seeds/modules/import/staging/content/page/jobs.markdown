# Who we are
An eclectic crew united by intellectual curiosity and a passion for creating truly great products.

TypoGraphics is spread out across 32 cities around the world. Everyone at TypoGraphics is free to live and work in the places they thrive, and most of us do just that.

We’re authors, artists, designers, do-it-yourselfers, tinkerers, travelers, chefs, campers, readers, race car drivers, raconteurs, programmers, photographers, parents, poets, pilots, and pet lovers.

We run the gamut in geography, lifestyle and interest, but we’re united by a common set of values and goals: do exceptional work, build the best product in the business, experiment, pay attention to the details, treat people right, tell the truth, have a positive impact on the world around us, give back, and keep learning.

Collectively, we’ve run a profitable and popular business for 22 years straight, launched a widely popular programming framework (Ruby on Rails), written best-selling books, and a whole lot more.

# Who you are
Rock star? Pass. Friendly and thoughtful? Let’s talk.

In broad strokes, Managers of One thrive at TypoGraphics. If you consider yourself an eager learner, a conscientious worker, and a thoughtful, kind, supportive human, you might just have a home here.

What we’re not looking for are ideological clones or people who are otherwise just like us. You hear a lot of talk from tech companies that diversity is important for making great software. 100% true, but diversity has deeper value beyond monetary. There are few better ways to expand your horizons and grow as a person than to put yourself in the company of others with different backgrounds, experiences and identities. So if you look at our team and don’t see yourself, don’t shy away. Come work with us. We’ll do some growing together.

# What it’s like to work here
A calm, collected environment where you can do your best work.

We work hard to make sure every employee is given the freedom, tools, trust, and support to do the best work of their careers. That's why so many people who work at TypoGraphics stay at TypoGraphics.

We value a calm company and deliberate, concerted effort. You’ll have a lot fewer meetings, a lot less email, and a lot less interruption. Turns out 8 hours are plenty of time to get work done when you don’t slice your day into tiny “work moments”.

It’ll take some getting used to if you’ve been immersed in ASAP culture, but after a while you’ll wonder how you worked any other way.

We work in small, independent teams, typically on a 6 week cycle. Everyone at TypoGraphics participates in Everyone On Support every few months, and twice a year we all get together in Chicago to work and play together. Trust falls are optional. Axe throwing is not. Read our employee handbook for more details on what it’s like to work at TypoGraphics. Make sure you check out the benefits and perks. Spoiler; they’re great.
